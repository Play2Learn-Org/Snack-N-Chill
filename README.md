# Snack-N-Chill

Enough with the stress at work, at home, in the super market, in the subway. Take some time for yourself, relax a little, and know that you're doing something for your future by playing this educative cooking business simulator.

## About

Inspired by Duolingo, [Cashflow](https://www.richdad.com/products/cashflow-classic), Sim City 2000, Democracy 3 and Factorio, we are building a business simulation game that should teach people similar skills [The Power MBA](https://www.thepowermba.com/de/) would, but not by moving you through courses, deadlines, homeworks etc. but by simply playing and relaxing. This way we hope to catch the long-tail of study-interested people, as well as a wider age-range.

That such a game can work shows Duolingo. If you don't apply other language learning methods you won't become fluent, but you will definitely grow your language skills each time you play it.

This way it should become easier for people to get into both cooking and business, because through simply playing the game they already built a foundation that they can put real life experience on top of.

Currently thinking about whether adding Youtube content on top would also be helpful to capture the completely unmotivated audience and prepare them for the game through passive consumption.
